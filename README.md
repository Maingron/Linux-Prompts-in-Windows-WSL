## How to use
- You need to have WSL installed
- You then need to add the run folder to your path variable
- Restart CMD
- Now you can use commands like `ls` within Windows.

## How it works
Basically you're just calling an alias that routes whatever through WSL, as long as an alias file exists (for example ls.cmd).

## Known Issues
- WSL can't access VeraCrypt drives by default
